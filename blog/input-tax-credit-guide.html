      <h4>Quick Summary</h4>
      <p>Input Tax Credit (ITC) lets you reduce the GST you owe by claiming credit for GST you've already paid on business purchases. It's GST's way of avoiding double taxation. This guide covers everything from basics to claiming rules.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- SECTION 1: WHAT IS ITC -->
  <div class="prose">
    <h2>What Exactly is Input Tax Credit?</h2>
    <p>Input Tax Credit (ITC) is the cornerstone of the GST system. In simple terms: <strong>ITC lets you subtract the GST you paid on purchases from the GST you collect on sales.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Think of it this way — when you buy raw materials or services for your business, you pay GST to your supplier. When you sell your product or service, you collect GST from your customer. ITC allows you to claim back the GST you paid, so you only pay tax on the value you added.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="info-box green">
    <div class="info-box-icon">📦</div>
    <div class="info-box-content">
      <h4>Real-Life Example</h4>
      <p><strong>You're a furniture maker:</strong><br>
      • You buy wood for ₹10,000 + ₹1,800 GST (18%) = ₹11,800 total<br>
      • You make a table and sell it for ₹20,000 + ₹3,600 GST (18%) = ₹23,600 total<br>
      • <strong>Without ITC:</strong> You pay ₹3,600 to the government<br>
      • <strong>With ITC:</strong> You pay ₹3,600 - ₹1,800 = <strong>₹1,800 only</strong><br><br>
      You claimed ₹1,800 as Input Tax Credit and saved that amount!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="prose">
    <h2>Why Does ITC Matter?</h2>
    <p>ITC is crucial because:</p>
  </div>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>Reduces your tax burden significantly</li>
    <li>Prevents cascading effect (tax on tax)</li>
    <li>Improves cash flow for your business</li>
    <li>Makes your products more competitive in pricing</li>
    <li>Ensures you only pay tax on value addition</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- SECTION 2: CONDITIONS FOR CLAIMING ITC -->
  <div class="prose">
    <h2>Conditions to Claim Input Tax Credit</h2>
    <p>You cannot claim ITC on every purchase. The GST law has specific conditions that must be met:</p>
  </div>

  <div style="margin-top: 28px;">
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-num">1</div>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h4>You Must Have a Tax Invoice</h4>
        <p>The supplier must give you a proper GST invoice showing their GSTIN, your GSTIN, HSN code, and GST amount separately. No invoice = No ITC.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-num">2</div>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h4>Goods/Services Must Be Received</h4>
        <p>You can only claim ITC after you've actually received the goods or services. Pre-payment ITC is allowed only after receipt.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-num">3</div>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h4>Supplier Must Have Filed Their GST Return</h4>
        <p>Your supplier must upload the invoice in their GSTR-1. If they don't file, your ITC claim can be rejected. This is auto-verified in the GST portal.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-num">4</div>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h4>You Must Have Paid the Supplier</h4>
        <p>If you don't pay your supplier within 180 days of the invoice date, the ITC gets reversed. Payment must be made to claim and retain ITC.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-num">5</div>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h4>Used for Business Purposes Only</h4>
        <p>ITC is only available on purchases made for business use. Personal expenses, even if GST is charged, cannot be claimed as ITC.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-num">6</div>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h4>You Must File GST Returns</h4>
        <p>To claim ITC, you must file your GSTR-3B return on time. Late filing can delay or deny your ITC claims.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- SECTION 3: BLOCKED CREDITS -->
  <div class="prose">
    <h2>Blocked Credits — What You CANNOT Claim</h2>
    <p>Section 17(5) of the CGST Act blocks ITC on certain purchases, even if they're for business use:</p>

  <!-- SECTION 4: HOW TO CLAIM ITC -->
  <div class="prose">
    <h2>How to Claim Input Tax Credit</h2>
    <p>The ITC claiming process is mostly automated through the GST portal:</p>
  </div>

  <div style="margin-top: 28px;">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Step 1: Verify Your Purchase Invoices</h3>
        <p>Log in to the GST portal → Go to <strong>GSTR-2B</strong> (auto-populated from supplier's GSTR-1). This shows all invoices where you can claim ITC.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card" style="margin-top: 16px;">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Step 2: Match with Your Books</h3>
        <p>Cross-check GSTR-2B invoices with your actual purchase records. Ensure all invoices are genuine and goods/services are received.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card" style="margin-top: 16px;">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Step 3: File GSTR-3B</h3>
        <p>In your monthly GSTR-3B return, claim ITC in Table 4. The system auto-fills eligible ITC from GSTR-2B, but you can manually adjust if needed.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card" style="margin-top: 16px;">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Step 4: Utilize ITC</h3>
        <p>Once claimed, ITC sits in your Electronic Credit Ledger. You can use it to pay your GST liability when filing returns. CGST credit pays CGST, SGST pays SGST, IGST can pay any.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- SECTION 5: REVERSAL OF ITC -->
  <div class="prose">
    <h2>When You Must Reverse ITC</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, ITC that was claimed earlier needs to be reversed (paid back). Common scenarios:</p>
  </div>

  <div class="info-box orange">
    <div class="info-box-icon">🔄</div>
    <div class="info-box-content">
      <h4>Reversal Scenarios</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Non-payment to Supplier:</strong> If you don't pay within 180 days, reverse the ITC + 18% interest<br>
        <strong>2. Goods Used for Personal Use:</strong> If business goods are taken for personal use, reverse ITC proportionately<br>
        <strong>3. Supplier Cancels Invoice:</strong> If supplier issues credit note or cancels invoice, reverse ITC immediately<br>
        <strong>4. Goods Lost/Stolen/Destroyed:</strong> ITC must be reversed if goods are lost, stolen, or destroyed (except by natural calamity)<br>
        <strong>5. Exempt Supplies:</strong> If you make both taxable and exempt supplies, reverse ITC proportionate to exempt supplies

        <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Business owners claim ITC on personal car, personal phone bills, family dinners labeled as "business meals."</p>
        <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> ITC is strictly for business use only. Personal expenses are blocked credits under Section 17(5).</p>

        <div class="fix-box">

        <p><strong>What happens:</strong> You claim ITC based on invoices, but supplier never uploaded them in GSTR-1 or didn't file returns.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> ITC is auto-matched with supplier's GSTR-1. If supplier doesn't file, your ITC claim gets rejected in reconciliation.</p>
        <div class="penalty-tag">⚠️ Risk: ITC disallowed + interest on tax shortfall</div>
        <div class="fix-box">
          <h4>✅ How to Fix</h4>
          <p>Always check GSTR-2B before claiming ITC. Follow up with suppliers who haven't filed. Consider advance payment clauses that require GST filing proof.</p>

        <div class="fix-box">

        <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Trying to use CGST credit to pay SGST, or vice versa.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> ITC utilization has strict rules: CGST credit → CGST/IGST only, SGST credit → SGST/IGST only, IGST credit → Any (IGST/CGST/SGST).</p>
        <div class="penalty-tag">⚠️ Risk: Return rejection + manual correction needed</div>
        <div class="fix-box">

  <!-- SECTION 8: ITC RECONCILIATION -->
  <div class="prose">
    <h2>ITC Reconciliation — Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>ITC reconciliation is matching your claimed ITC with what suppliers have reported. This prevents mismatches and notices.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="info-box blue">
    <div class="info-box-icon">🔍</div>
    <div class="info-box-content">
      <h4>How to Reconcile ITC</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Download GSTR-2B from portal (shows supplier-uploaded invoices)<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Match with your purchase register and accounting books<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Identify mismatches — missing invoices, wrong amounts, duplicates<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Contact suppliers to correct their GSTR-1<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Claim only matched ITC in GSTR-3B<br><br>
        <strong>Do this monthly</strong> — don't wait for year-end. Early reconciliation prevents big surprises during audits.

  <div style="margin-top: 28px;">
    <div class="info-box orange">
      <div class="info-box-icon">❓</div>
      <div class="info-box-content">
        <h4>Can I claim ITC if I lost the invoice?</h4>
        <p><strong>No.</strong> Invoice is mandatory. However, if supplier filed GSTR-1 and you have proof of payment, you can request a duplicate invoice from supplier.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box orange">
      <div class="info-box-icon">❓</div>
      <div class="info-box-content">
        <h4>What if supplier cancels their GST registration?</h4>
        <p>If supplier's registration is cancelled, all ITC claimed from them after cancellation date must be reversed immediately. Check supplier GSTIN status regularly.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box orange">
      <div class="info-box-content">
        <h4>Can I claim ITC for previous years?</h4>
        <p>ITC can be claimed up to <strong>30th November of next financial year</strong> or date of filing annual return (GSTR-9), whichever is earlier. After that, ITC lapses.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box orange">
      <div class="info-box-content">
        <h4>What is GSTR-2B and how is it different from GSTR-2A?</h4>
        <p>GSTR-2B is a <strong>static, auto-generated statement</strong> available after GSTR-1 filing deadline. GSTR-2A was dynamic (real-time). Use GSTR-2B for claiming ITC — it's the final, locked version.</p>
