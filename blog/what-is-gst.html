      <h4>In Short</h4>
      <p>GST is a single tax that replaced over 17 different taxes in India. It makes buying and selling goods and services simpler and more transparent.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="prose">
    <h2>What Exactly is GST?</h2>
    <p>GST stands for <strong>Goods and Services Tax</strong>. It is an indirect tax charged on almost every product and service sold in India — from your morning milk to the software your company uses.</p>
    <p>Before GST (launched on <strong>July 1, 2017</strong>), India had a complicated maze of taxes like VAT, Service Tax, Excise Duty, and many others. Imagine paying 5 different tolls on the same highway. GST replaced all of them with one single, streamlined tax.</p>

    <h2>How Does GST Work?</h2>
    <p>GST is charged at every stage of the supply chain — from manufacturing to the final sale to you. The key idea is called <strong>"Input Tax Credit"</strong>.</p>

        <h4>Real-Life Example: A Shirt Journey</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> A cotton farmer sells cotton to a factory. Factory pays GST on cotton.<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> The factory makes shirts, sells to a wholesaler. Wholesaler pays GST — but the factory gets back what it paid on cotton (Input Tax Credit).<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> The wholesaler sells to a shop. Shop pays GST — but gets back what it paid to the wholesaler.<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> You buy the shirt. You pay GST only once — on the final price.<br><br>
        🎯 <strong>Result:</strong> Tax is collected only on the value added at each stage. No double taxation!</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>What Are the GST Rates?</h2>
    <p>India has a tiered GST structure. Not everything is taxed at the same rate:</p>
  </div>

  <table class="styled-table">
    <tr>
      <th>GST Rate</th>
      <th>What Falls Here</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0% (Exempt)</strong></td>
      <td>Milk, fresh fruits, vegetables, basic foodgrains, healthcare services</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>5%</strong></td>
      <td>Rice, wheat, edible oils, branded snacks, public transport</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>12%</strong></td>
      <td>Smartphones, textiles, certain medicines, restaurant meals (non-AC)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>18%</strong></td>
      <td>AC restaurants, electronics, most services, business software</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>28%</strong></td>
      <td>Cars, tobacco, luxury goods, casinos</td>
    </tr>

    <h2>What is CGST, SGST, and IGST?</h2>
    <p>You might see these on your invoices. Here's the simple breakdown:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CGST (Central GST)</strong> — Goes to the Central Government. Charged on sales within the same state.</li>
      <li><strong>SGST (State GST)</strong> — Goes to the State Government. Also charged on sales within the same state.</li>
      <li><strong>IGST (Integrated GST)</strong> — Charged when you sell something from one state to another. It combines CGST + SGST into one tax.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <div class="info-box-content">
      <h4>Quick Example</h4>
      <p>Buy a laptop in Maharashtra (same state) at 18% GST → You pay <strong>9% CGST + 9% SGST</strong><br>
      Buy a laptop shipped from Delhi to Maharashtra at 18% GST → You pay <strong>18% IGST</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Who Needs to Register for GST?</h2>
    <p>Not everyone needs a GST number. You must register if:</p>
  </div>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>Annual turnover exceeds ₹40 lakhs (goods) or ₹20 lakhs (services)</li>
    <li>You sell goods across states (inter-state supply)</li>
    <li>You sell on e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Flipkart</li>
    <li>You are a casual taxable person or import services</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="prose">
    <h2>Why Does GST Matter for You?</h2>
    <p>Even if you are not a business owner, GST affects your daily life. It determines the price you pay for groceries, electricity, restaurants, and services. Understanding GST helps you know why prices are what they are, claim refunds if you're a business owner, avoid penalties, and make informed decisions when starting a business.</p>
