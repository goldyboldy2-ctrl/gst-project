# 🚨 CRITICAL: Missing Files Fix

## What's Wrong

Your GitHub repo is missing **4 critical files**:
1. `hsn-finder.html` ❌
2. `registration-checker.html` ❌
3. `return-deadlines.html` ❌
4. `budget-2026-changes.html` ❌

Plus your `index.html` and `style.css` are old versions.

**Result:** Tool cards on homepage lead to 404 errors.

## Files to Upload

### **ROOT LEVEL (9 files) — Upload to main folder**

Upload these to `goldyboldy2-ctrl/gst-project` root:

✅ style.css               (REPLACE - current one is old)

## How to Verify It Worked

**After uploading, test these URLs:**

1. https://mygstindia.in/ 
   - Should show **6 tool cards** (not 4)
   
2. https://mygstindia.in/hsn-finder.html
   - Should load HSN Finder tool (not 404)
   
3. https://mygstindia.in/registration-checker.html
   - Should load Registration Checker (not 404)
   
4. https://mygstindia.in/return-deadlines.html
   - Should load Deadlines calendar (not 404)
   
5. https://mygstindia.in/budget-2026-changes.html
